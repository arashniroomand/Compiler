# Compiler
This code appears to work as a lexer implementation in Python. A lexer is a component of a compiler or interpreter that breaks down the source code into tokens for further processing.
The code takes a source code file and reads its contents. It then splits the contents into individual lines and processes each line separately. Within each line, it iterates through the characters and identifies different tokens based on certain conditions.

The identified tokens are categorized into different types such as strings, numbers, identifiers, symbols, expressions, and comparisons. The tokens, along with their corresponding type, are stored in a nested list structure.

The read_file function utilizes the lexer function to process the contents of the source code file and returns the resulting tokenized lines.
